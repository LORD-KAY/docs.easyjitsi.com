## What is Jitsi?

Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.

Jitsi is a favorite videoconferencing solution for anyone with privacy concerns, journalists, for example. There’s a reason so many people use Jitsi Meet as a Skype alternative for video conferencing.

## Features of Jitsi

- Unlike other videoconferencing technologies, Jitsi Videobridge, the heart of Jitsi, passes everyone’s video and audio to all participants, rather than mixing them first.
- The result is lower latency, better quality and, if you are running your own service, a much more scalable and inexpensive solution.
- Jitsi is compatible with WebRTC, the open standard for Web communication.
- Jitsi supports advanced video routing concepts such as simulcast, bandwidth estimations, scalable video coding and many others.
- Ubuntu and Debian packages for easy installation.
