## Creating Pull Requests

- Make sure your code passes the linter rules beforehand. The linter is executed
  automatically when committing code.
- Perform **one** logical change per pull request.
- Maintain a clean list of commits, squash them if necessary.
- Rebase your topic branch on top of the master branch before creating the pull
  request.
